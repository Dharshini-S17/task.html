    <P class="first"> If you worry that people won't like your decisions, you will make decisions that would please them. If you do not care about people's opinions, you would finally do what you want to. Thinking about what people think of you is living in a prison cell with bars only in front of you. There is open space for you to run on the sides, yet what you choose is staying behind those bars. The simple formula to get out of those bars? Ask yourself:'WHAT DO I WANT?'</P>

    <p class="first">No one sees the mulitple failures before thath one 'huge success'. No one sees how you overcame your habits and systems despite having 'failed', because they focus on the end result, that you failed. What you become during the process of success and failure is what's most important. No one else would see it. Only you would. So be it, because that is your true life. Success or failure happened as a result. What you did and who you became was your life in true essence. 'Success and failure' were merely outputs. What you carry in your heart to react thaat destination is conclusive. </p>


    <p id="second">The best sportspeople have coaches who work on their mind training. Playing amidst the pressure of millons of eyeballs. Performing despite the media frenzy. Doing their best even when they're going through a heratbreak. Sports aren't only physical. Because anyone can get physically tough. Sports mostly involve mental game. No one sees it. Only you. It's the victory, the control of the mind, the joy of deciding what to focus on that leads to victory on the sports field. The inner world drives the extrnal one. ALWAYS. </p>
